    <h1 class="secondary-heading"><strong class="bold-text">License Plate Pre-sale Voucher FAQ</strong></h1>
    <div class="text-block"><strong>What is a voucher?</strong><br>Upon the Florida Legislature’s approval of any new specialty license plate, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) is required to collect voucher pre-sales before the new license plate may be produced and distributed to the various tag offices and tax collectors for purchase. The voucher pre-sale requirement for specialty license plates is 3,000.  <br><br>Once 3,000 pre-sale vouchers are sold, license plates will be printed and delivered to Florida Tax Collector Offices for distribution. This production process takes about 4-5 months. After license plate delivery, there is one year for customers to redeem their vouchers or to buy a plate outright. Any person with a voucher can purchase the plate. Folks without a voucher can also buy a license plate.<br><br>3,000 license plate registrations must be renewed annually to remain in production and available to new customers year after year. If the plate falls below 3,000 renewals in any given year, the plate will be placed in a probationary status for one year and then discontinued until Florida Legislative approval once again. If the plate goes above 3,000 during that one year of probation, then probation is waived.<br><strong><br><br>Can I purchase a pre-sale voucher but not redeem it for a license plate to display on my car? </strong> <br>Yes - a pre-sale voucher is assigned to a person. However, once a customer takes their voucher and redeems it for a license plate, it is assigned to a vehicle. Folks cannot keep their issued license plates at home as a souvenir. Here’s what this means: <br><br>A customer that does not intend to put a specialty license plate on their car can still purchase a pre-sale voucher to support the benefiting organization. Purchasing a pre-sale voucher helps Hatzalah South Florida Emergency Medical Services (HSF EMS) meet the 3,000 pre-sale requirement to put the license plate into production. HSF EMS will receive $75,000 ($25 of every $33 pre-sale voucher benefits HSF EMS. $8.00 is retained by FLHSMV) if 3,000 pre-sale vouchers are sold. <br><br>A customer can buy a pre-sale voucher and never redeem it for a license plate. The goal of pre-sale vouchers is to fundraise for the benefiting organization and help meet the 3,000 pre-sale requirement to print the license plates, making them available to everyone in Florida for purchase.<br><br><strong><br>Can I purchase a voucher if I’m not a Florida resident?</strong> <br>Non-Florida residents can also purchase vouchers as gifts for friends or family who are Florida residents using their Florida license plate numbers.<br>‍<strong><br><br>Can I order a plate and not put it on my car? </strong><br>No. Once a customer takes their pre-sale voucher and redeems it for a license plate, or buys a license plate outright, it is assigned to a vehicle. Folks cannot keep their issued license plates at home as a souvenir. You will also have to swap out an existing license plate for the newly purchased plate. <br><strong><br><br>When is the pre-sale time period for the Florida Stands with Israel specialty plate vouchers?</strong><br>The pre-sale time period was extended to October 14, 2024, by which point 3,000 pre-sale must be sold.<br><strong><br><br>May an individual purchase multiple vouchers?</strong><br>Absolutely! Vouchers can be purchased for individual use or as gifts. The customer and recipient (who may be the same person) must have a Florida driver license or ID card and a vehicle to put the license plate on. For companies, the FEID is required.<br><strong><br><br>What if someone lives out of state?</strong><br>A person living out of state may purchase a voucher if they are willing to provide a legible copy of their out-of-state identification. However, it is ideal that the voucher be purchased by someone who will have a Florida vehicle registration by the time of manufacture of the license plate.<br><strong><br><br>Why do you collect purchaser and recipient information?</strong><br>The State of Florida allows anyone to purchase a specialty plate pre-sale voucher for themselves or for another person as long as the recipient is the holder of a Florida driver license or registration. If they are purchasing the voucher for another person, they should clearly indicate that at time of purchase.<br><strong><br><br>Are pre-sale vouchers refundable or transferrable?</strong><br>If the license plate does not meet it’s pre-sale requirement, the fees will be refunded. However, they are not refundable for any other reason. Pre-sale vouchers are non-transferrable.<br><strong><br><br>How can I track voucher sales?</strong><br>Pre-sale voucher sales can be tracked on the homepage of www.floridastandswithisrael.org<br><strong><br><br>Will there be additional fees when the license plate is manufactured?</strong><br>In most cases, yes. The voucher will cover the specialty plate for the rest year once the plate has been manufactured and is available at local tax collector’s offices. If a license plate is not due for a mandatory replacement (every 10 years), the purchaser will likely need to pay a fee between $28.00 -$36.90 to replace it. These fees do not cover the annual registration renewal fees. <br>The fee collected for a voucher allows the sponsoring organization to begin manufacturing the plate once the pre-sale threshold has been reached.<br><strong><br><br>Is the order link for Escambia residents only?</strong><br>No. Any Florida motorist may use the site. The recipient, if different from the purchaser, must have a Florida driver license or vehicle registration.<br><strong><br><br>What will the customer receive as proof of purchase?</strong><br>Your customer will receive an email receipt and confirmation. The voucher will be attached to their driver record in the State of Florida’s registration system. They will be able to redeem it at any tax collector’s office once the plates are produced and they request the plate at time of renewal or as an on-demand plate replacement.<br><strong><br><br>How do personalized plates work?</strong><br>Once the plate meets its pre-sale requirements and is manufactured, you may order a personalized version of the plate through any tax collector’s office. The “Florida Stands with Israel” specialty plate is a “side design” plate and limited to five alpha-numeric characters.<br><strong><br><br>What type of vehicles are eligible for a voucher purchase?</strong><br>They may be placed on private vehicles, company vehicles, trailers (utility, RVs, boat, etc), heavy trucks (under 7,999 gvw), and motorhomes.<br><strong><br><br>Can vouchers be purchased for motorcycles?</strong><br>Not at this time. Currently, Florida has limited options for motorcycle-sized license plates.<br><strong><br><br>Can a business buy multiple plates for their vehicles?</strong><br>Yes. A business may buy a voucher for each of the vehicles and trailers. It may be possible to deduct all or a portion of the fees, depending on their tax situation.</div>
